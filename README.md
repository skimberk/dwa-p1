#DWA Project 1

##Description
A simple website which contains some information about myself, and links to my other projects. For now, the links are just placeholders, but they will be updated within the next few months.

##Live URL
<http://p1.dwa.sebastian.io/>

##Demo
There will not be a demo for the first project (at least that's what the DWA website claims).

##Details for teaching team
None. The website is a super simple static portfolio.

##Outside code
I'm using Typekit for the fonts.
